So, the ciphertext uses the converted alphabet, mapping it with each character in the original one.

I do this one by one, first knowing that “E” is the most used in speech every day, and relating to that, after using an online tool https://www.dcode.fr/frequency-analysis to analyze the frequency of the character. Then we can easily see that in the ciphertext, “N” is the most used, so we map “N” with “E”, then try to find words like ```a```, ```and```, ```the```, ```he```,```him```, ... And then after about 1h30', I was able to finish the dictionary(I leave it in another file).

I know there is a way to code this, but I'm too lazy to do this, so if u are free and have time for it, feel free to leave an issue or contribute directly to the project, thank u so much

```
Phileas fogg was not known to have either wife or children, which may happen to the most honest people; either relatives or near friends, which is certainly more unusual. he lived alone in his house in saville row, whither none penetrated. a single domestic sufficed to serve him. He breakfasted and dined at the club, at hours mathematically fixed, in the same room, at the same table, never taking his meals with other members, much less bringing a guest with him; and went home at exactly midnight, only to retire at once to bed. he never used the cosy chambers which the reform provides for its favoured members. he passed ten hours out of the twenty-four in saville row, either in sleeping or making his toilet. ```
